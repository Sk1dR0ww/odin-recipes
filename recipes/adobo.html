                    <p class="text">My Filipino Mom taught me how to make this traditional dish following the recipe her mother taught her. And though I've made a couple of changes, I guarantee they're Mom-approved. 'Lolah' is 'Grandma' in the Philippines, in case you were wondering. Serve over steamed rice.</p>
                    
                <h2 class="text">Ingredients:</h2>
                    <ul class="text">
                        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry</li>
                        <li>6 gloves garlic</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup of soy sauce</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li> 
                        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons pickling sauce</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2 class="text">Steps:</h2>
                    <ol class="text">
                        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until oil is shimmering. Cook garlic in oil for no more than 30 seconds. Add all of the chicken to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is white all over. Do not brown.</li>
                        <li>Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, and water, and add the pickling spice. Make sure the spice ball is submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and place lid on pot so that some steam can escape. Simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.</li>
